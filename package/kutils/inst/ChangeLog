	* ../R/assignMissing.R (assignMissing): overhaul with
	documentation to deal with different inputs for doubles, integers,
	factors

	* ../R/project.R (initProject): Sys.which("git") to check if
	user's system has git in path. Could we search more aggressively
	if it exists elsewhere?

	* ../R/deleteBogusRows.R (deleteBogusRows): add arguments drop,
	verbose, and n, use NCOL. Argument n allows NULL or NA values.
	(deleteBogusColumns): a column version of deleteBogusRows. Should
	have planned ahead and written one function with a margin
	argument, may come back later work on that.


2016-08-01  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/peek.R (varType): if noneoftheabove variables are not
	present, do not print a warning about having to exclude them.
	Rocket Science Alert.

	* ../R/utils.R (floorvar): delete. I cannot think of any
	reasonable use case for this.
	(starsig): insert new argument symbols to allow users to have
	whatever symbols they want.

	* ../R/peek.R (varType): revise to allow single columns in
	addition to data frames

2016-07-31  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/project.R (initProject): new function to create project
	directories, starts git repo, adds readme and changelog files.

2016-07-29  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/histOMatic.R: fix documentation about arguments, reformat
	as details.

2016-07-28  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/histOMatic.R (quickbar): histargs, barargs inserted,
	using to reduce warnings due to arguments that do not fit.

	* ../R/utils.R (removeMatches): new function, adapted from Ben
	Kite code
	(mgsub): multi-gsub function, adapted from loose recollection of
	something Jared harpole wrote.

	* ../R/histOMatic.R (varType): dots arguments for pdf are now
	extracted. Corrected ask logic when file is true. New, richer
	examples showing combinations.

2016-07-27  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/histOMatic.R: change histOMatic to "look", handles
	numeric, string, or factor variables, can output on screen, in
	file, also option to put text in session.

	* ../R/updatePkgDepends.R: Accelerate by vectorization, insert
	BIOC as repo, clean up docs

2016-05-23  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@dellap14>

	* ../R/utils.R (stars): The stars function conflicted with
	base package stars, so rename "starsig"

2016-03-08  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@dellap14>

	* TODO: Created a TODO file, and ChangeLog for first time
