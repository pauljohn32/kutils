	(alphaOnly): insert "also" argument

2016-10-24  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (## keyUpdate):demonstrate mydf case after
	adding Jan to new data

2016-10-20  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/updatePkgDepends.R (updatePackages): pass through arguments
	ask and checkBuilt from command line to update.packages.

2016-10-09  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/project.R (initProject): insert new rheader file which
	defines usual directories, named "rheader.R" in the R folder

2016-10-06  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (keyTemplate): Changed naming so that key
	templates are suffixed by "templ" and the edited keys will be
	"key". No more "key_new" or "keylong_new", but now just "key" and
	"key_long".
	(keyUpdate): rework handling of new variables and new values,
	relabel argument from bottom to append, new example stress tests.
	(keyApply): was accidentally allowing stringsAsFactors=TRUE, which
	prevented some variable class assignments.

2016-09-23  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/utils.R (padW0): fix error that was causing integers to
	turn to all NA.
	(stringbreak): vectorize stringbreak.

2016-09-22  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (wide2long): rework to correct handling of
	recodes and missings, which should not be repeated throughout
	the column when there is only one value.

2016-09-21  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (long2wide): correct problem that NA values
	were turned to "NA" strings in missings and recodes.

2016-09-20  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (keyApply): The use of split was causing
	the name_old.new values to be alphabetized.  We don't want that.
	(keyUpdate): 1) T -> TRUE. 2) replace "wide" with "long" for
	consistency with other functions 3) Don't do wide == TRUE,
	recommended to do isTRUE(wide). Inserted comments to suggest
	change in design.
	(long2wide): create name_old.new and set as factor with
	ordering from original key, trying to prevent re-alphabetization.
	(wide2long): insert sep argument, use while splitting key input.
	(keyImport): Rip apart keyImport, redesign as key importer and
	cleaner. This should handle all cleanup of user input and make
	sure column names are correct. Does NOT return keylist object,
	make separate function for that.
	(makeKeylist): Does work previously by keyImport. Only called
	from inside keyApply, so as to simpify user experience.

2016-09-09  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (cleanDataFrame): new function that applies
	safeInteger and checks that the data frame is made of columns, no
	matrices embedded.
	(keyApply): Ignore capitalization of "name_old" in scanning for
	columns in data frame.
	(smartSave): new function that does file save
	(keyStacker): pile up key templates

2016-09-08  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (safeInteger): new function to coerce
	numerics that are "close enough" to integers as integers.
	(keyTemplate): new argument safeNumericToInteger, uses
	safeInteger to set classes on columns in data frame being
	recoded.
	(keyDiagnostic): conditionalize the confidentiality protecting
	rounder argument.
	(wide2long): Correct example, it verifies now!
	(long2wide): Correct example, it verifies now!

2016-09-03  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/utils.R (padW0): front-pad values with zeroes.

2016-09-01  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (wide2long): new utility key converter function.
        (long2wide): new utility key converter function.

2016-08-30  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (keyApply): use assignRecode in for loop, so
	each element in the recodes is applied in a sequence.

2016-08-29  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (assignRecodes): new function to apply the key

2016-08-22  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (keyDiagnostic): new function to compare old
	and new data against variable key
	(keyApply): Dealing with duplicated factor levels problem,
	avoiding them, reassinging values correctly. If $v$value_old is
	empty, what to do?  Too risky to assing value_new in that case,
	cutting out code which tried to guess and do so.

2016-08-21  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (keyImport): Redesign to allow multiple name_new for a
	single name_old. names on keylist object are "name_old.name_new"
	for clarity.

2016-08-19  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/variableKey.R (getValues): max.levels change. If integer or
	character is over the limit, then just print one line in key, just
	as we do for real number variables.
	* vignette/variablekey.lyx: revise commentary about keyTemplate to
	match new interpretation of max.values.

2016-08-17  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/utils.R (stringbreak): New function to insert "\n" into strings

	* ../R/peek.R (quickbar): barplot error because some category
	values too ridiculously long. Now implement LIMIT, will later
	insert line breaks

	* ../R/utils.R (shorten): add shorten funtion with unique

2016-08-12  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/modelcomparison.R (compareCFA): insert @export and @importFrom

	* ../R/modelcomparison.R (compareCFA): fitMeasures -> lavaan::fitMeasures
	(compareCFA): break long lines in stop with paste()

2016-08-11  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/assignMissing.R (getUnique): pack the keyTemplateLong and
	keyTemplate functions into one single function with the argument
	long = TRUE/FALSE to differentiate them.

	* ../R/project.R (initProject): output "there is no git" message.

2016-08-11  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@dellap14>

	* ../R/assignMissing.R (recodeDF): first working version

2016-08-10  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/assignMissing.R (cleanDF): rough in work to
	apply a keylist object to a data frame.

2016-08-09  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/assignMissing.R (n2NA): n2NA accepts more arguments for
	types of values to be removed; zapspace argument.

	* ../R/assignMissing.R (zapspace): remove leading and trailing spaces.

2016-08-08  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@dellap14>

	* ../R/assignMissing.R (unique2): In keyimport, chose plan to
	create an output list.

	* ../R/assignMissing.R (keyTemplateLong): make strings, not
	factors in new key.

2016-08-03  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/assignMissing.R (keyTemplateLong): remove usage of openxlsx
	in function, put as example, add Suggests to DESCRIPTION document.

2016-08-02  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/assignMissing.R (assignMissing): overhaul with
	documentation to deal with different inputs for doubles, integers,
	factors

	* ../R/project.R (initProject): Sys.which("git") to check if
	user's system has git in path. Could we search more aggressively
	if it exists elsewhere?

	* ../R/deleteBogusRows.R (deleteBogusRows): add arguments drop,
	verbose, and n, use NCOL. Argument n allows NULL or NA values.
	(deleteBogusColumns): a column version of deleteBogusRows. Should
	have planned ahead and written one function with a margin
	argument, may come back later work on that.


2016-08-01  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/peek.R (varType): if noneoftheabove variables are not
	present, do not print a warning about having to exclude them.
	Rocket Science Alert.

	* ../R/utils.R (floorvar): delete. I cannot think of any
	reasonable use case for this.
	(starsig): insert new argument symbols to allow users to have
	whatever symbols they want.

	addition to data frames

	* ../R/project.R (initProject): new function to create project
	directories, starts git repo, adds readme and changelog files.

2016-07-29  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/histOMatic.R: fix documentation about arguments, reformat
	as details.

2016-07-28  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/histOMatic.R (quickbar): histargs, barargs inserted,
	using to reduce warnings due to arguments that do not fit.

	* ../R/utils.R (removeMatches): new function, adapted from Ben
	Kite code
	(mgsub): multi-gsub function, adapted from loose recollection of
	something Jared harpole wrote.

	* ../R/histOMatic.R (varType): dots arguments for pdf are now
	extracted. Corrected ask logic when file is true. New, richer
	examples showing combinations.

2016-07-27  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@delllap-16>

	* ../R/histOMatic.R: change histOMatic to "look", handles
	numeric, string, or factor variables, can output on screen, in
	file, also option to put text in session.

	* ../R/updatePkgDepends.R: Accelerate by vectorization, insert
	BIOC as repo, clean up docs

2016-05-23  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@dellap14>

	* ../R/utils.R (stars): The stars function conflicted with
	base package stars, so rename "starsig"
