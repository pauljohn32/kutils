Description: Tools for data importation, recoding, and inspection
    that are used at the University of Kansas Center for Research
    Methods and Data Analysis. The main feature here is the 
    systematic implementation of the "variable key" framework
    for data importation and recoding.  We are eager to have
    community feedback about the variable key and the vignette
    about it.
